\begin{tightlist}
        \item Employed as a federal contractor by the Veterans Association to work with Professor DeMazumder and his lab
        \item Developing a digital twin screening system using a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict hidden cardiovascular disease from electronic health records.
\end{tightlist}}
\jobsection{Software Engineering Contractor}{Hermit Tech}{February 2025 – Present}{
\begin{tightlist}
        \item Designing an automatic data pipeline which takes in duckdb data file processes the data to create a SQL file which can be read by evidence.dev to create a dashboard on a publicly accessible site.
        \item Designing CSS and markdown for use in landing page and documents
        for client use.
\end{tightlist}}
\jobsection{Bioinformatics Engineer}{Signature Diagnostics}{July 2023 – November 2024}{
\begin{tightlist}
        \item Worked with Dr. Paul Cohen at Signature Diagnostics, an early-stage biomedical startup that develops non-invasive methods of prenatal screening.
        \item Conducted analyses on RNA-Seq data to determine which classification method and set of genes would yield the best classifier for various genetic diseases.
        \item Augmented a proprietary algorithm that served as a binary classifier with a data filtering algorithm, transforming the classifier into a multiclass classifier.
        \item Used RAG to assist LLMs in distinguishing between severe and mild forms of preeclampsia.
\end{tightlist}}
\jobsection{Spectroscopy and Vision Science Researcher}{Purdue University}{August 2022 – November 2024}{
\begin{tightlist}
        \item Collaborated with Professor Thomas Beechem at Purdue University's Mechanical Engineering department to develop a data-lean algorithm that processes spectroscopy data using non-negative matrix factorization to detect contaminants in mediums such as water.
        \item Wrote and developed figures for a publication describing the processing algorithm for which I am first author; currently in the process of editing and submitting it.
        \item Served as lead programmer in a mechanical engineering lab. Created a GitHub repository for the lab and instructed lab members on GitHub use.
